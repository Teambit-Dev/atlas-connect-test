# CSS Reset

This package exports a CSS file which provides a minimal reset along with base styles for many HTML elements. It is meant to be used as a basis for all styling to be built upon.

## Try it out

Interact with a [live demo of the @atlaskit/css-reset component](https://aui-cdn.atlassian.com/atlaskit/stories/@atlaskit/css-reset/1.0.1/).

## Installation

```sh
npm install @atlaskit/css-reset
```

## Using the component

### Importing

The `@atlaskit/css-reset` package can be consumed via the dist, or in Webpack.

#### Importing in Webpack

```js
import '@atlaskit/css-reset';
```

The Webpack style loader should then place the CSS within the HEAD of your HTML element.

#### Importing in HTML

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="node_modules/@atlaskit/css-reset/dist/bundle.css" />
  </head>
